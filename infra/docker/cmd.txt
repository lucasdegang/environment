### Containers

# terminal

> Getting started
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

> Img Mongo 
docker pull mongo

> Container with default port with same name 
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo -v /data/db:/data/db

[ part 1 - docker run -d] : Here, we are running the docker container with a detached mode. there are two mode to run docker container. one is detached and another one is interactive mode. Detached mode will run in background whereas interactive mode runs in the foreground(terminal will be active).
Problem with interactive mode is if you close the terminal, container will stop running.

[ part 2 - -p 27017:27017] : Here, -p represents the port of the container. you can map the port of the container and your machine port to communicate with the container. As MongoDB always run in port 27017, we map the ports here.

[ part 3 - --name mongodb mongo ] : After that, we added flag --name which represents the docker container name. you can specify the name you want to have it for your mongoDB container.

[ part 4 - -v /data/db:/data/db ] : Lastly, we mount the volume of docker container and local machine volume. This is one of the important commands in the whole part.
-v /data/db:/data/db mount the volume of docker container db directory and local machine db directory. so that, you won't lose your database data even after restarting the container.
